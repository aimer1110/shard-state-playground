# Shard Local State Playground

Please note, this is **NOT** a production feature repository. This is only an experimental repository to implement a modified Merkle Patricia tree in Go that fits the needs of a sharded Ethereum blockchain.

## Goals of This Repository

This is an experiment. The goals of this are:
- To implement a variety of state sharding schemes including but not limited to: sparse Merkle trees, binary trees optimized for sharding, reed-solomon structures
- To rapidly prototype on top of geth's trie package
- To spark discussion on various approaches to sharding Ethereum's Merkle tree
- To potentially explore a data availability layer and fraud proof integration with sharded state

## Contributions & Communication
